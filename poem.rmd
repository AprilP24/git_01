’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the realm where dreams take flight,  
A wondrous creature brings delight.  
With wings aglow, so soft and light,  
A fairy dances through the night.  

Her gown adorned in colors rare,  
With petals woven through her hair.  
Ethereal grace and gentle flair,  
She spreads enchantment everywhere.  

From dew-kissed meadows to moonlit glades,  
She weaves her magic in hidden shades.  
Whispers of secrets in woodland cascades,  
A guardian of nature's serenades.  

With each flutter of her delicate wings,  
She sprinkles stardust and joy she brings.  
Granting wishes and granting dreams,  
In her presence, life truly gleams.  

Through ancient forests and shimmering streams,  
The fairy glides, a vision it seems.  
Guardian of creatures, large and small,  
She watches over them, one and all.  

With mischief twinkling in her eyes,  
She enchants the world with sweet surprise.  
Her laughter rings like a lullaby,  
Echoing through the midnight sky.  

But heed her warning, oh mortal soul,  
Respect her realm and keep it whole.  
For fairies thrive where hearts are pure,  
In harmony with nature's allure.  

So let us cherish the fairy's grace,   
And honor her magical embrace.
